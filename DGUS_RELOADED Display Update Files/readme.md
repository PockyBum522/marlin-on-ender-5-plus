I think these are the same files as the ones here: https://github.com/Desuuuu/DGUS-reloaded

I'm reuploading them because I know they work with the version of Marlin in the Marlin 2.1.2 Source folder, just in case they're different. I don't remember where exactly I got them.

Follow the ender 5 plus normal display update procedure. Format microSD card with FAT32 and 4096k blocks. Copy the DWIN_SET folder onto the root of the SD card, put it into the SD card slot on the on the back of the stock creality display, turn on the printer control box and wait for the blue screen that says the display resource files have been updated to say UPDATE END or whatever it says. Then you can flash the version of marlin in this repo to the mainboard.
